### PlanGrid

Radio question. You are given a function :


strength(long frequency)


This returns the signal strength given a radio frequency which is a long. You are tasked to return the 10 strongest frequencues. Frequencies can be between 88.1 - 102.1 and increment by 0.2. Ex[88.1,88.3,88.5]


Answ: Loop through the frequencies and maintain a Min or Max heap

### Bloomberg

Return the first character in a string that occurs only once
"aabbcddeefgg" = c
"Saif Ali Khan" = S

Given a sorted array of positive and negative intergers, square each element and return a sorted list


Ex [-5,-2,0,1,2,4] = [0, 1 ,4 ,4 ,16, 25]


You can solve this by putting the negative numbers in a sorted array and the positive numbers in a sorted array then merging the two sorted arrrays (2n)


### Microsoft

Implement a stack with an Arraylist
Implement a Queue with a stack in n complexity
Given a sorted array of all ints from 0-51, return a shuffled array;

Find the # of islands in a matrix of 1s and 0s where 1 represents land and 0 is water
Ex  

0 1 1 0 0 1

0 0 0 0 0 0

0 1 0 0 0 1

0 1 1 0 0 1 

That contains 4 islands
